# FDA 510(k) Weekly Tracker — Regulatory Signals → Screening Long-list


## 0) What this is
A lightweight Excel-based workflow that turns **foiclass and FDA 510(k) event data** into:
1) a **one-page Weekly Summary** (weekly KPI snapshot),  
2) a set of **drill-down pivots** (Applicants / Clinical Area / Device Class / Recency), and  
3) a **Companies × Products long-list** used for early-stage screening and follow-up diligence.

**Design intent:** the output reads like a weekly internal update (clear, structured, review-ready), while the build demonstrates practical analyst skills (Power Query, pivots, Excel formulas, basic VBA automation and XLOOKUP).
